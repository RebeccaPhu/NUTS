<p>NUTS is a utility program for performing transfers of files between file systems, typically those used by older computers. NUTS operates similar to an FTP client, providing two browsing 'panes' between which files and be transferred.</p>
<P>NUTS is written to be 'agnostic' - that is the main program knows nothing about where the data is coming from (typically a file, but could be a CF card, a physical raw hard drive, a floppy disk interface, etc) nor does it know how that data should be interpreted. Instead, a series of plugins provide the interpretation of the raw data in a way that NUTS can display and process without needing to know the particulars of how that specific file system understands and deals with files.</P>
<p>Some of the features provided by NUTS include:<p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic file system detection.</li>
<li>Support for raw devices, with additional source supported via plugins.</li>
<li>Up to 16 attributes per file, specific to the file system in use.</li>
<li>Any number of file forks.</li>
<li>Custom icons for known file types.</li>
<li>Basic file type identification for cross-system type-guessing.</li>
<li>Translation of old file types into modern formats (graphics, text and audio)</li>
<li>Unsorted file systems (typically cassette images) with filename re-use</li>
<li>Nested file system support</li>
<li>&quot;Foreign Object&quot; support - files from one system embedded in a generic container file system (e.g. ZIP files, ISO images)</li>
<li>File System repair tools</li>
<li>Filesystem space usage report (where applicable)</li>
</ul>
