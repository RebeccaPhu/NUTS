<p>Files (or directories) can be deleted by selecting the relevant objects in the viewer pane, then either accessing the {page:context,context menu} (by right-clicking or by pressing the context menu key), or using the 'Delete' shortcut on the {page:sidebar,sidebar}.</p>

<p>If the selection includes one or more directories, they will be recursed into automatically and the contents deleted from the bottom up.</p>

<p>If the file system allows multiple files with the same name, then the item at the specific location(s) will be deleted - i.e. objects with the same name that are NOT selected will NOT be deleted.</p>

<p>If the 'Confirm File Operations' {page:options,control option} is not set, then you will be asked to confirm deletion of files by selecting 'Yes' or 'No'. This will be asked for each object to be deleted, unless 'Yes To All' is selected (in which case all relevant objects will be deleted without further prompting), or 'No To All' is selected (in which case, no further files will be deleted).</p>
