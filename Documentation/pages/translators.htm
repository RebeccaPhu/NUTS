<p>NUTS supports 'translators' that are able to read file formats from other systems and translate them to more standard formats.</p>

<p>The following translator types are supporrted:</p>

<ul>
<li>{page:gfx}<br><br>Displays a file as a single-frame graphic (possibly with alternating colours), with options for interpretation (screen mode) and a simple set of effects for entertainment purposes. Allows printing of the resulting frame, copying to the clipboard, and saving as an uncompressed 24-bit Windows bitmap.<br><br><br></li>
<li>{page:txt}<br><br>Displays a file as a text body, with options for copying the text (in whole or selection), saving as a text file, or printing the whole file.<br><br><br></li>
<li>{page:audio}<br><br>Opens an audio player window to play the file as an understood sound or music file. Allows saving the audio as an uncompressed WAV file (44.1kHz; 8/16 bits and mono/stereo will vary).<br><br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: It is possible to open more than one file in a translator at once, and to open several selected files at once each with it's own translator window, by using the items in the submenus of the 'Translate As' submenu of the {page:context}.</p>

<p>Many plugins with define a translator so that it can be launched simply by '{page:basics,entering}' the object. However, the functionality to open multiple objects at once may be limited if the selection contains objects that are not translateable - i.e. they do not have a default translator assigned to them.</p>
