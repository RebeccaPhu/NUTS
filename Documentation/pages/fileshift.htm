<p>Some file systems, notably {page:tapes}, are ordered - i.e. the order of the files is important in some way. For example, on tape images the order of files is the order they would be encountered if the tape were played linearly from start to finish.</p>

<p>In these cases, NUTS will enable the 'Move Up' and 'Move Down' shortcuts on the {page:sidebar,sidebar}. These can be used on one file at a time to move a file to a different position in the sequence.</p>

<p>Note that a file system allowing files to be re-ordered does not necessarily mean that multiple files with the same name are permitted, and vice-versa.</p>
