<p>NUTS has two ways to prepare a new file system.</p>

<h2>Formatting an existing device or file</h2>

<p>At any point that supports it, you can select 'Format...' from the {page:context,Context Menu} to {page:format,reformat} a file or device to a new file system. This largely presumes the file as exists is already the right size for the desired format. If it is not, you should delete the file and use the New Image Wizard.</p>

<h2>Creating a new image</h2>

<p>The {page:newimage,New Image Wizard} can be used to create new container images in the current file system. It can be selected from the {page:context,Context Menu} or the shortcut of the {page:sidebar,Side Bar}. Creating a new image presumes that the low-level format option cannot be used, but this is not always the case. The image is created in the current directory of the relevant filesystem / {page:basics,Viewer Pane}, according to the file system's file naming {page:files,semantics}.</p>
