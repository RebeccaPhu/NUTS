<p>The text translators are the simplest of the translator types. Typically they operate on BASIC program files that are stored in a tokenised format, however two built-in text translators also exist.</p>

<p>Text Translators are accessed via the 'Text' submenu of the 'Translate' submenu of the {page:context,context menu}. Alternatively, some files may be automatically identified as text files by a file system handler, and as such 'entering' these files will automatically load them into the appropriate translator.</p>

<p>The text window is read only, but otherwise supports the expected functions of a text window, including the ability to select a text block and copy it to the clipboard.</p>

<p>The toolbar at the top of the window has basic options for controlling the window:</p>

<h2>Font Switch</h2>
<p>This button cycles through the fonts available to render the text according to its {page:fonts,encoding}. The encoding is taken from the encoding specified for the file by the file system handler.</p>

<h2>Copy Text</h2>
<p>Copies the selected text (or the whole text file if none is selected) to the clipboard.</p>

<h2>Save Text</h2>
<p>Saves the whole text as a plain text file.</p>

<h2>Print Text</h2>
<p>Prints the whole text using the current font to render the characters.</p>
