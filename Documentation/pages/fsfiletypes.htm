<p>Because NUTS allows transfers between disperate file systems, a system of 'FS File Types' is used. These are internal identifiers (not visible to the user) that classify files according to the kind of system they originated from.</p>

<p>When copying files, the receiving file system will examine the FS File Type of the source file. If the type is one that is recognised, then the attributes can be interpreted accordingly and the file stored appropriately. Thus copying files between two BBC Micro disk images (for example) will always result in the load and execute addresses being preserved.</p>

<p>However, if the FS File Type of the incoming file is not recognised, then the receiving file system will make a best-effort attempt to store the file anyway, using whatever default specification would seem suitable at the time. For example, the Sinclair plugin will store a file with an unrecognised FS File Type as a 'Bytes' file, starting at memory address 16384 (4000 hex). If the automatically assigned attributes are unsuitable, they can be changed via the file's {page:props,properties}.</p>

<p>Some file systems have two kinds of FS File Type. This occurs when the file system can be a container for {page:fop,foreign objects}. The source file has one type for the recognised 'foreign' file type, and one other type representing the container file system itself. NUTS plugins will pick up the correct type to preserve the information during the transfer.</p>

<p>Certain file systems (notably Windows and ZIP files) will accept or create '{page:sidecars,sidecar}' files. These are additional files that contain extra information that is part of the file, but cannot be stored in the file in the receiving file system. Examples include .INF files for files copied from BBC Micro images, that hold the load and execute addresses, and 'dot undescore' files that are used to hold the resource fork and Finder information for files normally held in Apple Macintosh file systems. See the {page:sidecars} page for more information on sidecar files and their manipulation.</p>
